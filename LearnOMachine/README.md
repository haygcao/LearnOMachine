<b>LearnOMachine (A Gold Price Prediction system using Machine Learning Algorithms)</b>

•	The Goal of this project is to accurately predict the future adjusted closing price of Gold ETF across a given period of time in the future.

•	For this project, I have used different Machine Learning Algorithms and ensemble the solution model by combining the top three performing models to predict the Adjusted closing price of the GLD ETF using a dataset of past prices. 

•	Implemented using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit Learn and Django website to predict future prices.
