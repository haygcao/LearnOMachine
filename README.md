###Prediction of Gold ETF prices using Machine Learning algorithms

Historically, gold had been used as a form of currency in various parts of the world including USA. In present times, precious metals like gold are held with central banks of all countries to guarantee re-payment of foreign debts, and also to control inflation which results in reflecting the financial strength of the country.
Recently, emerging world economies, such as China, Russia, and India have been big buyers of gold, whereas USA, South Africa, and Australia are among the big seller of gold.Forecasting rise and fall in the daily gold rates, can help investors to decide when to buy (or sell) the commodity. But Gold prices are dependent on many factors such as prices of other precious metals, prices of crude oil, stock exchange performance, Bonds prices, currency exchange rates etc.
We in this project would forecast gold rates using the most comprehensive set of features and would apply various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and compare their results. We also identify the attributes that highly influence the gold rates. 


###Objectives

Following are the objectives of the Web Application. 
•	It helps investors to decide when to buy or sell a commodity. 
•	To enable commoners to easily invest in gold. 
•	To inform investors or any users about the gold prices including all the details. 
•	It can predict prices of gold up-to next four years. 
•	To inform people about the changes in gold prices. 
•	To predict prices of gold in a particular month.
•	To enable discussions among the investors about the drop and hike in the gold prices with the help of a story telling graph.
